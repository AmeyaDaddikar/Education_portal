	American for-profit education company that ran a real estate training program from 2005 until 2010. 
	It was owned and operated by The Trump Organization. (A separate organization, Trump Institute, was licensed by 
	Trump University but not owned by the Trump Organization.) After multiple lawsuits, it is now defunct. It was 
	founded by Donald Trump and his associates, Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny, in 2004. The company offered 
	courses in real estate, asset management, entrepreneurship, and wealth creation.[2]
	
	The organization was not an accredited university or college. It did not confer college credit, grant degrees, or grade its students.
	[3] In 2011, the company became the subject of an inquiry by the New York Attorney General's office for illegal 
	business practices that resulted in a lawsuit filed in 2013.
